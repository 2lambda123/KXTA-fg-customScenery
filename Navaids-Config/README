Info:
The files in this directory update the Flightgear Scenery Database and include
VORs, Fixes, and other navaids that may be inaccurate due to not being FAA
published.

These are very useful for Fly-simulation in the Homey Area, and therefore we
distribute them here

Instructions:

A. To patch flightgear the original file must be replaced. This is achieved by
overwriting the respective file in your Flightgear Data path

Example

Patching nav.dat.gz

Overwrite the file 
$FG_Data/Navaids/nav.dat.gz in your flightgear distribution with the one found
in this custom scenery package in Navaids-Config/Navaids directory

NOTE: You may want to make a backup of the file here before.

B. To revert this change, 

Replace the file, example nav.dat.gz file with the copy you had made in step A.
If you did not make a copy, you can use the apt.dat.gz.orig file provided in
this package, reverting to the changes up to DEC2014. Simply rename this
file as nav.dat.gz and then copy it in the directory indicated in Step A
